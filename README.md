# CS-320 Software Test Automation Portfolio

## Overview

This repository contains selected project files and reflective writings from my coursework in CS-320 at Southern New Hampshire University. The course focuses on software test automation and quality assurance, with a strong emphasis on developing practical skills in writing and maintaining automated tests, as well as understanding and applying different testing strategies based on requirements.

## Contents

### Project One: Contact Management System
- **Files**:
  - `Contact.java`: This class defines the structure and attributes of a contact in the management system.
  - `ContactService.java`: Manages all contact operations, including creating, updating, and deleting contacts.
  - `ContactTest.java`: Contains unit tests for validating the functionality of the Contact class.
  - `ContactServiceTest.java`: Includes tests for ensuring the reliability of the ContactService operations.

### Project Two: Reflective Report
- **Summary and Reflections**: A detailed report discussing the methodologies, challenges, and learnings from the project. This document also includes reflections on the course content and its application to real-world scenarios.

## Reflections

### Ensuring Functional and Secure Software
To ensure that software is both functional and secure, I integrate comprehensive testing strategies throughout the development lifecycle. By employing a mix of unit tests, integration tests, and security assessments, I can identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities and functionality errors early. Continuous Integration (CI) systems are instrumental in facilitating ongoing testing, ensuring that all new code contributions are evaluated before integration into the main codebase.

### Interpreting and Incorporating User Needs
Understanding user needs is paramount to the success of any software project. Through techniques like the "5 Whys" and direct observation, I gather deep insights into user expectations and behaviors. Prototyping is a critical step in this process, allowing for iterative feedback that directly shapes the development process. This approach ensures that the final product aligns closely with user requirements and expectations.

### Approach to Designing Software
My approach to software design is characterized by an open, inquisitive mindset aimed at thoroughly understanding the project requirements and stakeholder visions. Through active elicitation and iterative design processes, I ensure that the software evolves appropriately in response to user feedback and changing requirements. This method not only enhances the adaptability of the software but also ensures that it remains aligned with the end-user's needs.

## Conclusion

Reflecting on my work throughout the CS-320 course has reinforced the importance of structured testing, user-centered design, and continuous adaptation in software development. These projects have provided me with invaluable insights and skills that I am confident will serve me well in my future endeavors in the field of software testing and automation.
